  Data subsets are created for different analytical tasks, ensuring modular and reusable code.
  
# Model Integration:
  Machine learning models (train_regression_model, train_classification_model) are trained during app initialization.
  Prediction results and test data are visualized interactively.
  
# UI and Visualizations:
  Dynamic, visually appealing charts for KPIs, trends, and segmentation.
  Additional insights are supported by anomaly detection.
  
# Workflow => 

# Home Page:
  Welcomes the user with an introduction and a header image.
  
# Sales Analysis:
  Visualizes sales trends and supports interactive filtering to explore specific regions, categories, or sub-categories.
  
# Regression Models:
  Displays regression model performance and predictions for sales and revenue.
  
# Customer Segmentation:
  Provides insights into customer demographics using predefined segmentation features.
